### Contributing
Your contributions are always welcomed but for easier and faster code review please consider:

* Feature branches are created from develop
* When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop
* Create a descriptively named branch
* Every branch should only fix one issue, this way branches can be merged easier
* Each commit should only change one thing, this way commits can be reverted easier
* When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
* Refrain from adding tools and technologies that increase the complexity of the project
